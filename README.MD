# E-commerce API Project

This is a project built to serve a different e-commerce front end project. It is a full featured back-end application from the authentication work flow to stripe check out process. 
I used express.js framework with mongoDB serving as the database. 


#### It has the following workflows

 - Auth
 - User
 - Product

 - Order
